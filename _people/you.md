### About Myself
I'm interested in Computer Graphics, High-Performance Visualization and all kinds of GPU stuff. I'm dreaming of voxels and breathing pixels.
I like to work independently but can also blend into a team when working on a collaborative project. 

### Education Profile
* MSc Computer Science, Math, Physics or similar
* BSc Computer Science, Math, Physics or similar

### Professional Profile
* I've done a bunch of things but professionally I'm just a nerd.
